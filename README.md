# tb_pet_shelter
This is training team project for the development of a telegram bot for the shelter of cats and dogs. 
This bot can answer popular questions from people about the shelter and what you need to know and be able to take a pet from the shelter. 
The bot can request and receive daily reports from new owners about the pet's adaptation to new conditions.
